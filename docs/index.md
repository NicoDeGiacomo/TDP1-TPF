There are three types of moves: normal, split and merge.  
To swap between move modes, you can press:
 - `n` For normal mode. Color:![normal](https://via.placeholder.com/15/00ffff/000000?text=+)
 - `s` For split mode. Color:![split](https://via.placeholder.com/15/fa0fb4/000000?text=+)
 - `m` For merge mode. Color:![merge](https://via.placeholder.com/15/008000/000000?text=+)

Normal is the default type.\
You can see which mode you are currently in, by looking at the color of the asterisk placed in the top-right corner of the screen.

##### Normal Move
The Normal Move is a classic move of a piece, just like in a normal chess game.\
The pieces follow all of the same movement patterns as those in standard chess, including moves like castling and en passant. However, there is no concept of check, so the king can move into, or castle through, what would be considered check in classical chess.

_Click on a piece, the piece will be selected, and then click on the destination._

##### Split Move
All non-pawns can perform a split move. This move allows the piece to split and occupy two different target squares that it can reach.\
Only squares that are unoccupied are considered legal targets.

_Press `s` and click on a piece (the piece will be selected). Then click on two empty squares._

##### Merge Move
All non-pawns can perform a merge move. This move is designed to undo a split move, therefore two splits of the same piece merge together in a valid square that both splits can reach.\
Only squares that are unoccupied, or are occupied by one of the splits being merged are considered legal targets.

_Press `m` and click on a piece (the piece will be selected). Now click on a second piece, and finally on the destination of the merge._
